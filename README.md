🚀 IntelliPrep – AI-Powered Interview Preparation System

An intelligent interview preparation platform that evaluates technical, HR, and aptitude responses using Machine Learning and NLP techniques. The system provides automated scoring, feedback, resume analysis, and performance tracking through an interactive dashboard.

🎯 Project Overview

IntelliPrep is designed to simulate real interview environments and provide data-driven evaluation of candidate responses. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Computer Vision to assess answers, analyze resumes, and evaluate HR round performance.

This system aims to reduce interview anxiety and improve candidate preparation through objective feedback.
